Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices ,"Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all hardware devices on the network so that only authorized devices are given access, and unauthorized and unmanaged devices are found and prevented from gaining access. ","Attackers, who can be located anywhere in the world, are continuously scanning the address space of target organizations, waiting for new and unprotected systems to be attached to the network. Attackers also look for devices (especially laptops) which come and go off of the enterprise's network, and so get out of synch with patches or security updates. Attacks can take advantage of new hardware that is installed on the network one evening but not configured and patched with appropriate security updates until the following day. Even devices that are not visible from the Internet can be used by attackers who have already gained internal access and are hunting for internal jump points or victims. Additional systems that connect to the enterprise's network (e.g., demonstration systems, temporary test systems, guest networks) should also be managed carefully and/or isolated in order to prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations. ",CSC 1-1,Do you deploy an automated asset inventory discovery tool and use it to build a preliminary asset inventory of systems connected to an organization's public and private network(s)?  Do you employ both active tools that scan through network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic ?,1,Deploy automated asset inventory,"This Control requires both technical and procedural actions, united in a process that accounts for and manages the inventory of hardware and all associated information throughout its life-cycle. It links to the business by establishing information/asset owners who are responsible for each component of a business process that includes information, software, and hardware. Organizations can use large-scale, comprehensive enterprise products to maintain IT asset inventories. Others use more modest tools to gather the data by sweeping the network, and manage the results separately in a database. ",How long does it take to detect new devices added to the organization's network (time in minutes)?
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices ,,,CSC 1-2,"Do you deploy dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server logging, and utilize a system to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems through this DHCP information ?",1,Deploy DHCP server logging,"Maintaining a current and accurate view of IT assets is an ongoing and dynamic process. Organizations can actively scan on a regular basis, sending a variety of different packet types to identify devices connected to the network. Before such scanning can take place, organizations should verify that they have adequate bandwidth for such periodic scans by consulting load history and capacities for their networks. In conducting inventory scans, scanning tools could send traditional ping packets (ICMP Echo Request) looking for ping responses to identify a system at a given IP address. Because some systems block inbound ping packets, in addition to traditional pings, scanners can also identify devices on the network using transmission control protocol (TCP) synchronize (SYN) or acknowledge (ACK) packets. Once they have identified IP addresses of devices on the network, some scanners provide robust fingerprinting features to determine the operating system type of the discovered machine.",How long does it take the scanners to alert the organization's administrators that an unauthorized device is on the network (time in minutes)?
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices ,,,CSC 1-3,"Do you ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network ?",1,Automatic update to Inventory system,"In addition to active scanning tools that sweep the network, other asset identification tools passively listen on network interfaces looking for devices to announce their presence by sending traffic. Such passive tools can be connected to switch span ports at critical places in the network to view all data flowing through such switches, maximizing the chance of identifying systems communicating through those switches.",How long does it take to isolate/remove unauthorized devices from the organization's network (time in minutes)?
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices ,,,CSC 1-4,"Do you maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device?  Do you identify devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data , regardless of whether they are attached to the organization's network ?",2,Maintain Asset Inventory,"Many organizations also pull information from network assets such as switches and routers regarding the machines connected to the network. Using securely authenticated and encrypted network management protocols, tools can retrieve MAC addresses and other information from network devices that can be reconciled with the organization's asset inventory of servers, workstations, laptops, and other devices. Once MAC addresses are confirmed, switches should implement 802.1x and NAC to only allow authorized systems that are properly configured to connect to the network.","Are the scanners able to identify the location, department, and other critical details about the unauthorized system that is detected (yes or no)?"
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Devices ,,,CSC 1-5,Do you deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network? The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.,2,Deploy Network level authentication,"Wireless devices (and wired laptops) may periodically join a network and then disappear, making the inventory of currently available systems churn significantly. Likewise, virtual machines can be difficult to track in asset inventories when they are shut down or paused. Additionally, remote machines accessing the network using virtual private network (VPN) technology may appear on the network for a time, and then be disconnected from it. Whether physical or virtual, each machine using an IP address should be included in an organization's asset inventory.",

Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software ,"Actively manage (inventory, track, and correct) all software on the network so that only authorized software is installed and can execute, and that unauthorized and unmanaged software is found and prevented from installation or execution. ","Attackers continuously scan target organizations looking for vulnerable versions of software that can be remotely exploited. Some attackers also distribute hostile web pages, document files, media files, and other content via their own web pages or otherwise trustworthy third-party sites. When unsuspecting victims access this content with a vulnerable browser or other client-side program, attackers compromise their machines, often installing backdoor programs and bots that give the attacker long-term control of the system. Some sophisticated attackers may use zero-day exploits, which take advantage of previously unknown vulnerabilities for which no patch has yet been released by the software vendor. Without proper knowledge or control of the software deployed in an organization, defenders cannot properly secure their assets.",CSC 2-1,Do you deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system?,1,Deploy Application whitelisting technology,"Whitelisting can be implemented using commercial whitelisting tools or application execution tools that come with anti-virus suites and with Windows. Commercial software and asset inventory tools are widely available and in use in many enterprises today. The best of these tools provide an inventory check of hundreds of common applications used in enterprises, pulling information about the patch level of each installed program to ensure that it is the latest version and leveraging standardized application names, such as those found in the common platform enumeration specification.",How long does it take to detect new software installed on systems in the organization (time in minutes)?
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software ,,"
Poorly controlled machines are more likely to be either running software that is unneeded for business purposes, introducing potential security flaws, or running malware introduced by an attacker after a system is compromised. Once a single machine has been exploited, attackers often use it as a staging point for collecting sensitive information from the compromised system and from other systems connected to it. In addition, compromised machines are used as a launching point for movement throughout the network and partnering networks. In this way, attackers may quickly turn one compromised machine into many. Organizations that do not have complete software inventories are unable to find systems running vulnerable or malicious software to mitigate problems or root out attackers.",CSC 2-2,"Have you devised a list of authorized software and version that is required in the enterprise for each type of system, including servers, workstations, and laptops of various kinds and uses? Is this list monitored by file integrity checking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified ?",1,list of SW monitored by file integrity checking,"

Features that implement whitelists of programs allowed to run are included in many modern endpoint security suites. Moreover, commercial solutions are increasingly bundling together anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewall, and host-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), along with application white and black listing. In particular, most endpoint security solutions can look at the name, file system location, and/or cryptographic hash of a given executable to determine whether the application should be allowed to run on the protected machine. The most effective of these tools offer custom whitelists based on executable path, hash, or regular expression matching. Some even include a gray list function that allows administrators to define rules for execution of specific programs only by certain users and at certain times of day.",How long does it take the scanners to alert the organization's administrators that an unauthorized software application is on a system (time in minutes)?
Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software ,,,CSC 2-3,Do you perform regular scanning for unauthorized software and generate alerts when it is discovered on a system?

Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software,"Establish, implement, and actively manage (track, report on, correct) the security configuration of laptops, servers, and workstations using a rigorous configuration management and change control process in order to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerable services and settings. ","As delivered by manufacturers and resellers, the default configurations for operating systems and applications are normally geared to ease-of-deployment and ease-of-use - not security. Basic controls, open services and ports, default accounts or passwords, older (vulnerable) protocols, pre-installation of unneeded software; all can be exploitable in their default state.",CSC 3-1,Have you established and ensured the use of standard secure configurations of your operating systems? Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. ,1,Use of standard secure configurations,"For a complex enterprise, the establishment of a single security baseline configuration (for example, a single installation image for all workstations across the entire enterprise) is sometimes not practical or deemed unacceptable. It is likely that you will need to support different standardized images, based on the proper hardening to address risks and needed functionality of the intended deployment (example, a web server in the DMZ vs. an email or other application server in the internal network). The number of variations should be kept to a minimum in order to better understand and manage the security properties of each, but organizations then must be prepared to manage multiple baselines. ",How long does it take to detect configuration changes to a network system (time in minutes)?
Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software,,"Developing configuration settings with good security properties is a complex task beyond the ability of individual users, requiring analysis of potentially hundreds or thousands of options in order to make good choices. Even if a strong initial configuration is developed and installed, it must be continually managed to avoid security ""decay"" as software is updated or patched, new security vulnerabilities are reported, and configurations are ""tweaked"" to allow the installation of new software or support new operational requirements. If not, attackers will find opportunities to exploit both network-accessible services and client software. ",CSC 3-2,"Do you implement automated patching tools and processes for both applications and for operating system software? When outdated systems can no longer be patched, do you update to the latest version of application software and remove outdated, older, and unused software from the system ?",1,Implement automated patching tools,"Commercial and/or free configuration management tools can then be employed to measure the settings of operating systems and applications of managed machines to look for deviations from the standard image configurations. Typical configuration management tools use some combination of: an agent installed on each managed system, or agentless inspection of systems by remotely logging in to each managed machine using administrator credentials. Additionally, a hybrid approach is sometimes used whereby a remote session is initiated, a temporary or dynamic agent is deployed on the target system for the scan, and then the agent is removed.",How long does it take the scanners to alert the organization's administrators that an unauthorized configuration change has occurred (time in minutes)?
Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software,,,CSC 3-3,Do you limit administrative privileges to very few users who have both the knowledge necessary to administer the operating system and a business need to modify the configuration of the underlying operating system?

Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation ,"Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers. ","Cyber defenders must operate in a constant stream of new information: software updates, patches, security advisories, threat bulletins, etc. Understanding and managing vulnerabilities has become a continuous activity, requiring significant time, attention, and resources.
Attackers have access to the same information, and can take advantage of gaps between the appearance of new knowledge and remediation. For example, when new vulnerabilities are reported by researchers, a race starts among all parties, including: attackers (to ""weaponize"", deploy an attack, exploit); vendors (to develop, deploy patches or signatures and updates), and defenders (to assess risk, regression-test patches, install).
Organizations that do not scan for vulnerabilities and proactively address discovered flaws face a significant likelihood of having their computer systems compromised. Defenders face particular challenges in scaling remediation across an entire enterprise, and prioritizing actions with conflicting priorities, and sometimes-uncertain side effects. ",CSC 4-1,Do you run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk? ,1,Run automated vulnerabilities scanning tools,"A large number of vulnerability scanning tools are available to evaluate the security configuration of systems. Some enterprises have also found commercial services using remotely managed scanning appliances to be effective. To help standardize the definitions of discovered vulnerabilities in multiple departments of an organization or even across organizations, it is preferable to use vulnerability scanning tools that measure security flaws and map them to vulnerabilities and issues categorized using one or more of the following industry-recognized vulnerability, configuration, and platform classification schemes and languages: CVE, CCE, OVAL, CPE, CVSS, and/or XCCDF.","How long does it take vulnerability scanning systems, if they detect unauthorized devices on the network, to generate an alert (time in minutes)?"

Vulnerabilities can be present for many reasons, including coding mistakes, logic errors, incomplete requirements, and failure to test for unusual or unexpected conditions. Examples of specific errors include: the failure to check the size of user input; failure to filter out unneeded but potentially malicious character sequences from input streams; failure to initialize and clear variables; and poor memory management allowing flaws in one part of the software to affect unrelated (and more security critical) portions. There is a flood of public and private information about such vulnerabilities available to attackers and defenders alike, as well as a robust marketplace for tools and techniques to allow ""weaponization"" of vulnerabilities into exploits.

The file or exploit contains executable code that runs on the victim's machine either automatically or by tricking the user into executing the attacker's content. If the victim user's account has administrative privileges, the attacker can take over the victim's machine completely and install keystroke loggers, sniffers, and remote control software to find administrative passwords and other sensitive data.

Incident Response and Management ,"Protect the organization's information, as well as its reputation, by developing and implementing an incident response infrastructure (e.g., plans, defined roles, training, communications, management oversight) for quickly discovering an attack and then effectively containing the damage, eradicating the attacker's presence, and restoring the integrity of the network and systems. ","When an incident occurs, it is too late to develop the right procedures, reporting, data collection, management responsibility, legal protocols, and communications strategy that will allow the enterprise to successfully understand, manage, and recover. Without an incident response plan, an organization may not discover an attack in the first place, or, if the attack is detected, the organization may not follow good procedures to contain damage, eradicate the attacker's presence, and recover in a secure fashion. Thus, the attacker may have a far greater impact, causing more damage, infecting more systems, and possibly exfiltrate more sensitive data than would otherwise be possible were an effective incident response plan in place.",CSC 18-1,Do you ensure that there are written incident response procedures that include a definition of personnel roles for handling incidents?

Secure Network Engineering ,"Make security an inherent attribute of the enterprise by specifying, designing, and building-in features that allow high confidence systems operations while denying or minimizing opportunities for attackers. ","System or security designers rarely get to start from scratch and build in all of the security features they might want. And even if they did, systems constantly evolve, new business imperatives appear, attackers develop new techniques, and new technologies emerge to complicate the security problem. In such an environment, attackers take advantage of missing security features, time gaps in deploying new defenses or moving information, and the ""seams"" between defensive controls. Defenders are quickly overwhelmed with new operational requirements, managing tools and changes, new information, and ""fire-fighting"".
